### Question

<!--
Before submitting it, please ensure that this was not already asked in another issue.

This issue should serve for you to ask a question about this accompanying repo to the tutorial on CircleCI's blog and the resulting CI/CD build.

Also, ideally this issue should culminate in a PR to this repo and/or the tutorial on CircleCI's blog so that future developers will have that doubt cleared.
